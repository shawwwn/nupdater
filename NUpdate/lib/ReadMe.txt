| FAQ
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¤ Q: There is no exe, how do I run it!?!?
  A: It's not an executable program, it's a .NET 3.5 Class Library.
     Unless you're a programmer you won't find this useful.

¤ Q: How do I use this library?
  A: Preferably you use Visual Studio with the 3.5 framework. Other environments
     *may* also be able to use it, but that's beyond my current knowledge.
     Just add a reference to the DLL and you can use the included classes.

¤ Q: I still don't know how to use it!
  A: There are some samples (example code) and there's a reference for use with
     intellisense (an external xml-file, just make sure it's in the same folder
     as the dll). Apart from this it's up to you. Writing a complete reference
     describing every aspect of mpq is way too much work. Sorry!

¤ Q: Can I have the source code for the dll?
  A: At the moment - no. I'm planning on releasing it as open source later, but
     I wan't it to be more complete and bugfree first.
